# LD Specification Detailed Checklist (IEC 61131-3 Ed.3)

Use this checklist to review and sign off LD specification quality, implementation profile
alignment, and test/evidence traceability.

Repository anchor:
- `/home/johannes/projects/trust-platform-merge-run`

Truth policy:
- Keep `[x]` only when implementation (or doc), validation, and evidence are all present.
- If any one of those is missing, reset to `[ ]`.
- Every checked item should include evidence in the `Evidence` field.
