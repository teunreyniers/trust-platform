# IEC Decisions Log

This file tracks implementation decisions made where IEC 61131-3 leaves room for interpretation.

## 2026-02-25 - LD deterministic network traversal

- Area: Ladder Diagram (LD) execution ordering
- IEC context: LD network scan/evaluation ordering requirements and deterministic scan-cycle behavior (IEC 61131-3 Ed.3, LD semantics and standard FB timing tables)
- Decision:
  - Networks are evaluated strictly by ascending `network.order`.
  - Within a network, node processing order is deterministic (`x`, then `y`, then `id`) after topology expansion.
  - Parallel branch merge power is resolved as logical OR over incoming branch legs.
- Reason:
  - Guarantees reproducible behavior across platforms and editor layout variance.

## 2026-02-25 - Invalid topology handling

- Area: LD graph integrity
- IEC context: Implementations must provide deterministic behavior and reject malformed programs.
- Decision:
  - Ladder engine validates graph integrity before execution.
  - Unknown edge endpoints, disconnected nodes, and cycles are rejected with actionable diagnostics.
- Reason:
  - Prevents non-deterministic execution and hidden runtime faults.

## 2026-02-25 - Buffered write commit boundary

- Area: scan-cycle write semantics
- IEC context: PLC scan-cycle model (read -> evaluate -> update outputs)
- Decision:
  - Writes are buffered during network evaluation and committed only at end-of-scan.
- Reason:
  - Preserves scan determinism and avoids same-scan cascade side effects.

## 2026-02-27 - LD variable modeling policy (symbolic-first)

- Area: LD operand naming and address binding
- IEC context: IEC variable section/scope rules (Section 6.5.2.2, Figure 7) and LD operand usage in Section 8.2
- Decision:
  - The normative LD spec is symbolic-first: users SHOULD model LD with declared variables.
  - Direct addresses (`%I/%Q/%M`) remain allowed as an implementation form for hardware binding.
  - Local vs global separation follows IEC declarations (`VAR*`, `VAR_GLOBAL`, `VAR_EXTERNAL`) instead of editor-only heuristics.
- Reason:
  - Aligns LD with IEC declaration semantics and improves portability across targets.

## 2026-02-27 - Edition baseline and compatibility statement for LD

- Area: LD standard baseline
- IEC context: IEC 61131-3 Edition 3.0 (2013-02) superseding Edition 2 (2003)
- Decision:
  - Edition 3.0 is authoritative for LD conformance in this repository.
  - Core LD semantics are specified to remain compatible with common Edition 2 usage patterns.
- Reason:
  - Keeps a single normative baseline while avoiding unnecessary migration breakage for existing LD logic.
